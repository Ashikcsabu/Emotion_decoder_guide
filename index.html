					<h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
					<p>
						Emotional intelligence in AI refers to the ability of systems to identify and respond to human emotions, making interactions more intuitive and human-like. These systems analyze gestures, facial expressions, postures, and the tone and pitch of human voices to interpret emotional cues. Based on this, AI can adapt its responses, offering empathy or adjusting behavior to suit the user’s emotional state. This enhances user experiences in areas like customer support, healthcare, education, and entertainment. It’s a cool development that makes AI interactions feel more natural and personalized.

			<h1>How My Project Deals With Emotional Intelligence ?</h1>
			<div class="section">
				<p class="column2">
					My project leverages emotional intelligence by decoding emotions through audio analysis. While emotions can be interpreted from various cues like gestures, facial expressions, and voice tone, I focus on audio to capture emotional states. The uploaded video is processed to extract audio, which is then divided into 3-second chunks. Each chunk is analyzed to predict the emotional tone, enabling a detailed breakdown of emotions over time. This approach provides valuable insights into the emotional dynamics present in the audio, making it ideal for applications that rely on voice-based emotion recognition.
